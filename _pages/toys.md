Physical force feedback "toys" transform a virtual pinball cabinet from a monitor-on-a-box into something that genuinely *feels* like a real machine.

## 🎯 What Are Toys?

Toys are physical output devices triggered in real-time by game events — flippers firing, bumpers activating, knockers hitting. They're controlled via DOF (DirectOutput Framework) and a controller board like LedWiz or Pinscape.

## 🔧 Common Toys

### Shaker Motor
A 12V gear motor mounted under the playfield. Vibrates the cabinet during multiball, jackpots, and other events. One of the most impactful additions.

### Solenoids
Small electromechanical actuators that produce a sharp "thwack" — perfect for flipper feedback, bumper pops, and slingshots. Positioned under the playfield surface.

### Contactors
Heavier-duty solenoids for knocker effects. Loud and satisfying. Mount to the cabinet side or bottom.

### Gear Fan
Simulates the "whoosh" of a ball passing through the machine. Mounted to blow air across the playfield glass.

### LED Flashers
Dome LEDs (5W RGB) that replicate the strobe flash effects on real machines. Mounted behind the playfield or backglass.

### Beacon / Strobe
Rotating or strobing light effects for multiball chaos.

### Replay Knocker
A single solenoid that fires on high score or replay — classic pinball feel.
