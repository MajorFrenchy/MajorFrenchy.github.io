In this video, I walk through adding several new components to my cabinet kit — monitors, solenoids, and a 12V standalone setup.

## What Was Added

- Installing monitors (playfield + backglass)
- 12V Solenoid standalone from Cleveland Pinball
- Additional force feedback wiring

## Notes

This build uses a Cleveland Pinball solenoid kit wired independently from the main PC — a cleaner approach that avoids relying on the PC's USB power rail for solenoid current draw.

Check the [Parts](/parts) and [Toys](/toys) pages for sourcing info on the components shown.
