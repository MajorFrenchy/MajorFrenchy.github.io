## About the Dude Board

The Dude Board from Arnoz's shop is designed as a comprehensive controller for virtual pinball cabinets, handling output devices, lighting, and more from a single board. It's a solid alternative to piecing together LedWiz + Pinscape separately.

Check the [Arnoz shop](https://shop.arnoz.com) for availability and pricing.
