This is a new blog about the process of switching my current Windows Virtual Pinball cabinet to Linux.

## Introduction 

I always wanted to get a virtual pinball cabinet set up like the king Ron Popeil commercial ( SET IT AND FORGET IT! ). If you own a Arcade cabinet with Emulation Station or RetroPi , you set it up once and you don't touch the system ever. This is my goal with this setup, the difference is that on a Virtual Pinball cabinet we are adding new tables regularly. <br><br>

Over the years it has been a challenge to maintain a proper VP cab with Windows updates breaking the setup, changing the Anti-virus preferences and constent nagging screens to update or use Co-pilot. With the development of VPX Standalone it now allows to play Virtual Pinball on almost any plafforms including Linux. I am now starting my journey and going to turn my cabinet into a Linux cabinet and say goodbye to Windows.

## considerations
Moving to Linux has gotten easier over the years, Most people who heard of linux automatically thinks of "Geeks" , "command line" and a complicated operating system to use. There are some truth to this but the development and ease of use has come a long way. You can use a linux operating system without touching the console / command lines ever! 
<br>
Before moving to linux ask yourself the following questions? 
- Am i ready to learn something new?
- Am i ready to accept that certain features are not going to work and is going to be different from windows.
- Am i ready to spend some time tweaking and setting thing up from scratch
- Are you ready to go through your entire system and make it compatible with VPX standalone? VPX standalone requires a specific folder structure    that is different from Windows. I am going to discuss this requirement later.
  <br>
  <br>
Virtual pinball works well on Linux and many people have already used it for some time. There are some things still in development like
DOF and Pup Packs integration. DOF works but it is not consistent. Certain Pup packs work and some don't. Certain tables are not working
under Standalone ( Many tables have patches and works ) 
<br>
  The challenge VPX developers are facing is to make virtual pinball work flawlessly on Linux. They can achieve that by adding Plugins in VPX       Standalone and it allows support for windows only features like VBS and .Net. Not all tables are coded the same, not all puck packs are built  the same. The lack of consistency in the table making process makes it harder to achieve a stable experience in Linux. ( But we are getting there ) 
<br><br>
There are several versions of Linux, different builds, different "distros". I tested in the past Batocera which is a Distro dedicated to Gaming
  <a href="https://batocera.org">Batocera Site</a>. This now has VPX intergrated and is a solid solution. It is too locked down to my liking and
  i am looking more of an operating sytem than a kiosk mode. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For this project i decided to go with a unique Linux Distro called <a href="https://nobaraproject.org/">Nobara</a>. This Linux distribution
  is appealing for the following reasons. It ships with WINE dependencies, OBS Studio, popular multimedia codecs, and third-party repositories enabled. This will also support Steam and I hope to be able to play Pinball FX. I will report back on this later.
  <br><br>I spoke to other users who have
  tested Virtual Pinball on Linux and their choice of Distro are :( <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/">Debian 13</a>) and
 (<a href="https://archlinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>). You have to be careful when choosing your Linux Disto and stuck with one that is recommended. Fedora based build are recommended.
