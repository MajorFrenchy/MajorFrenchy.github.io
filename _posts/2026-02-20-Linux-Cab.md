## Introduction 

I always wanted to get a virtual pinball cabinet set up the to my liking and tweaking it to perfection. Over the years it has been a challenge with 
Windows updates breaking the setup, changing the Anti-virus preferences and constent nagging screens to update or use Co-pilot. With the development of VPX Standalone it allows to play Virtual Pinball on almost any plafforms including Linux. I am now starting my journey and going to turn my cabinet into a Linux cabinet and say goodbye to Windows.
